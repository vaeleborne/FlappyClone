I started on this project to showcase a few different skills. Beyond just C++ and SFML I wanted to 
utilize a few different common software design patterns. You will find some singletons, an observer pattern, 
a state machine, etc. This was designed on Apple Silicon and the makefile reflects that. If you are trying to compile 
check the make file. I would recommend just making your own project and linking sfml your preferred way, then moving the 
headers and cpp files into that project.
